    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "**PrimePack AG** buys packaging materials (pallets, cardboard boxes, tape) from multiple suppliers. Sustainability claims are increasingly scrutinised by customers and regulators. Employees need to answer questions like:\n",
    "> *\"What is the GWP of the Logypal 1 pallet, and is the figure verified?\"*  \n",
    "> *\"Can we tell a customer that the tesa tape is PFAS-free?\"*  \n",
    "> *\"Which of our suppliers have a certified EPD?\"*\n",

    "| Problem | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Internal document** | LLMs don't know about internal company documents. |\n",
    "| **Hallucination** | When asked about unknown products the LLM invents plausible-sounding but false figures. |\n",
    "| **No evidence trail** | Even when correct, a raw LLM answer cannot be traced back to a source document. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The RAG Solution\n",
    "RAG adds a **retrieval step** between the user's question and the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " Documents ──► Chunker ──► Embedder ──► Vector DB\n",
    "                                              │\n",
    " User query ─────────────────► Embedder ─────►  Retriever ──► Top-k Chunks\n",

    "                                                               LLM + Prompt\n",

    "The LLM only sees documents that are **actually in the corpus**. The answer can be traced to specific source chunks. If the corpus does not contain the answer, the LLM is instructed to say so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What RAG Does *Not* Fix\n",
    "RAG shifts the problem from hallucination to **retrieval quality**. If the right chunk is not retrieved, the answer will still be wrong (or absent). The later feature tracks address exactly this: better chunking, better retrieval, and better output structure."

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **chunk** is a short excerpt from a source document, a section of a PDF, one sheet of a spreadsheet, or one heading-delimited paragraph of a Markdown file. Chunks are the unit of indexing and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Chunk:\n",
    "    id: str           # unique identifier\n",
    "    title: str        # e.g. section heading\n",
    "    content: str      # the text that gets embedded\n",
    "    metadata: dict    # source_file, page, ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings\n",
    "An **embedding** converts text to a dense numeric vector (e.g. 384 dimensions). Semantically similar texts produce similar vectors. Here we use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, a compact local model that runs without an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store (ChromaDB)\n",
    "A **vector store** persists chunk embeddings on disk and supports approximate nearest-neighbour search. Given a query embedding, it returns the `top_k` most similar chunks in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever\n",
    "A **retriever** wraps a vector store and exposes a single `retrieve(query)` method. The baseline uses a `VectorStoreRetriever` with `top_k=5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Agent\n",
    "The **RAG agent** combines a retriever and an LLM. Its `answer()` method:\n",
    "1. Embeds the query\n",
    "2. Retrieves the top-k chunks\n",
    "3. Formats chunks as XML `<source>` tags in the prompt\n",
    "4. Calls the LLM and returns the answer + cited sources"
