Feature Track 1: Evaluation & Validation

Ground-truth queries and keyword check for the PrimePack AG RAG system.

Evaluation infrastructure comes from conversational_toolkit.evaluation (retrieval metrics) and RAGAS (generation quality).

The canonical question-answer pairs live in data/EVALUATION_qa_ground_truth.md. Edit EVALUATION_QUERIES below to add or adjust test cases.
